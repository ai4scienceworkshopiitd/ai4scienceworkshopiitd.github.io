            <h4>Geo-AI for Climate Action: Pinpointing CO2​ Emissions for Near Real-Time Accountability at National Scale</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Rising atmospheric CO2 is a major driver of global warming, making timely and accurate emission monitoring essential. Identifying sources such as oil and gas facilities, urban areas, and power plants is key to effective mitigation. In this talk, I present a high-resolution, top-down framework that combines satellite remote sensing and AI to estimate CO2 emissions. A machine-learning model integrates satellite CO2, weather, and human activity data to produce daily, high-resolution concentration maps. Background CO2 is then separated from weak anthropogenic enhancements using spatial segmentation and co-emitted tracers such as NO2, and these enhancements are converted into emission rates using a physics-based mass-balance approach. Results align closely with official annual CO2 inventories. Unlike traditional bottom-up methods, this approach provides near-real-time, continuous emission estimates across multiple sectors, including oil and gas.

            <h4>Accelerated Computing and Generative AI for Environmental and Climate Science</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Accelerated computing, combined with advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), is transforming scientific discovery by enabling faster and more scalable analysis of complex systems. By integrating AI with heterogeneous computing architectures such as GPUs, specialized accelerators, and high‑performance computing (HPC) platforms, scientific workflows can overcome traditional constraints of computational cost and time‑to‑solution. AI for Science leverages these capabilities to process large, high‑dimensional datasets, using physics‑informed and hybrid AI–simulation approaches to improve efficiency while maintaining scientific rigor. This talk highlights key challenges in Environmental and Climate Sciences and presents generative‑AI–enabled, accelerated computing solutions, illustrated through India‑specific use cases for climate risk, sustainability, and resilience.

            <h4>From Space to Policy: AI as an End-to-End Decision Engine for Air Quality</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Air pollution in India is a multi-scale systems problem, shaped by emission sources, atmospheric dynamics, sparse sensing, and high barriers to interpretation. This talk presents our efforts to build an end-to-end AI decision support ecosystem that connects satellite observation, physical sensing, atmospheric modeling, and human interaction. We develop learning- and information-theoretic methods for equitable sensor placement, satellite-based emission inventory construction through automated brick-kiln detection, and physics-informed neural emulators that reduce multi-hour atmospheric simulations to real-time what-if analysis. Finally, conversational systems such as VayuChat expose these models and datasets through accessible natural-language interfaces. Together, these components demonstrate how AI can move air-quality research from isolated models to actionable, interpretable, and participatory decision-making.

            <h4>AI-Powered Self-Driving Labs: Science as Digital Public Infrastructure</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Over the next decade, scientific research will undergo a fundamental shift -- from traditional, manual experimentation to AI-powered, autonomous experimentation enabled by self-driving labs. These labs will use AI to manage key parts of the experimental workflow, dramatically improving both the throughput, repeatability, and reproducibility of scientific discovery. To build self-driving labs, we need (a) foundation models across science and engineering domains that can apply scientific reasoning to generate viable hypotheses and select higher-probability experiments, (b) world models and control models that can execute experiments efficiently, safely, and consistently to maximize throughput and repeatability, and (c) action models that enable flexible and extensible robotic operations across diverse lab environments and scientific equipment while ensuring reproducible execution. Open Science Stack (OSS) is a non-profit initiative that is building the platforms needed to enable AI-powered self-driving labs. OSS is developing infrastructure that cleanly separates intent, execution, and control, while allowing AI to operate at the right level and time scale. By integrating structured experiment specifications, AI-driven reasoning, and robotic actuation, OSS enables autonomous feedback loops that continuously refine scientific workflows. OSS supports high-throughput, safe, and repeatable experiment execution at scale across domains, lab environments, and instruments, enabling reproducible outcomes across labs and researchers. By empowering researchers to automate real-world experiments, OSS aims to democratize access to advanced research infrastructure and accelerate scientific discovery.

            <h4>AI4Materials</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                The performance of most engineering applications, ranging from infrastructure, semiconductor devices, and energy is critically limited by the materials that are deployed and their associated properties. Hence, significant gains in performance of any application can arise from the usage of 'better' materials. However, designing better materials is historically a 'slow' process, limited by the throughput of experiments, calculations, and the general availability of data. Thus, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly those that work well in 'small data' domains can play a crucial role in accelerating the innovation at the materials level, thereby improving the devices that we use. In my talk, I will provide an overview of the typical AI/ML tools that are used (so far) in materials research and design, including examples from our own work. I will conclude with a few open-ended points that are still up for discussion in the use of AI/ML for materials design.

            <h4>Introduction to Agentic AI: Building Collaboration between AI and Domain Scientist</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Running sophisticated molecular simulations has traditionally required years of specialized training. A graduate student might spend their first year just learning how to set up a single type of calculation correctly, with subtle errors in input files leading to days of wasted computing time. This creates a bottleneck where even brilliant scientists with important questions must either become simulation experts themselves or depend entirely on the few specialists who are. Aura aims to change this by putting AI between researchers and the complexity. It's a conversational system where you describe your scientific questions such as how a new solar cell material conducts charges, how a potential drug binds to its target, or how a soap molecule organizes in water and intelligent agents translate that into the dozens of precise technical steps required. The system handles the tedious work of file format conversions, parameter selection, and error detection, while keeping researchers informed about possible underlying reasons. This doesn't replace expertise, but it dramatically lowers the barrier to getting started and reduces the cost of mistakes.

            <h4>Classical, Quantum and Hybrid AI Models for Solving Partial Differential Equations</h4>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                The solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) lies at the heart of scientific computing, governing phenomena across physics, engineering, and finance. In recent years, machine learning–based approaches have emerged as powerful alternatives to traditional numerical solvers, offering mesh-free formulations, improved scalability, and data-driven generalization.This talk presents a unified overview of classical, quantum, and hybrid AI models for solving PDEs. We begin with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), discussing their formulation, training dynamics, and practical challenges such as optimization stiffness and spectral bias. Building upon this foundation, we explore operator-learning frameworksincluding Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), highlighting their ability to learn solution operators and generalize across families of PDEs and boundary conditions.The talk then transitions to the quantum domain, introducing Quantum-Assisted Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QAPINNs) and Quantum DeepONets as a hybrid paradigm that integrates quantum computing within physics-informed learning pipelines. We discuss how quantum representations and hybrid quantum–classical training can potentially enhance their classical counterparts.
